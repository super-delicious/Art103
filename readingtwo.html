			<p class="myP"><strong>Q1. What are the differences between site specific art work and the idea of art interventions.</strong><br><br>
				Site-specific art is an artist who explicitly did work for a specific location. The installation of the work, in general, displays the work relate to the environment, and sometimes, it is linked to environmental art. <br>

				However, Art Intervention is an interaction with existing artwork, audience, venue/space, or circumstance. Art interventions are often purposeful because artists are trying to change existing situations, such as politics or economics. </p>

			<p class="myP"><strong>Q2. What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of Walter De Maria and Banksy? include your thoughts on how their work might interpret ideas of site specificness and interventions</strong><br><br>
				The similarity between Walter De Maria and Banksy is that both artists use their installation works to aware their audiences and connect the work concepts to the reality of our society.<br><br>

				The difference between them is that Walter De Maria's work is based on a particular location, is Site-specific art. Considering the environment, for example, the loft filled with Earth is located in the city of New York, called The New York
				Earth Room. However, Bansky has displayed his artwork as an ongoing public exhibit where he thinks appropriate for his purpose, is Art Intervention. For example, the Street Art Exhibition, selling his work on the roadside, called "Better Out
				Than In." </p>

			<p class="myP"><strong>Q3. What are some of the most common creative tactics and requirements that all the signs must share to be relevant and effective? Im talking about everything from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our
					home.</strong><br><br>The most common creative tactics and requirements must be clearly identifiable, with color contrast or bright colors, a simple graphic, and a readable font.
			</p>

			<p class="myP"><strong>Q4. What Kind of art, (not shown here), have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description, provide images if
					possible.</strong><br><br>I've been to Salvation Mountain, and it is located in the Lower Desert of Southern California in Imperial County just east of the Salton Sea and about an hour and a half from Palm Springs. It is 50 feet tall and
				150 feet wide and is made entirely of local adobe clay and donated paint. The sculpture is integrated into the local environment using local adobe clay. Especially the iconic cross and the big "God is Love" letter, with the red heart in the
				middle. The theme of "love" recurs at Salvation Mountain.

			<p class="myP"><strong>Q5. In class exercise. (In class on March 24th)</strong><br><br>
				I find the store is crowded even in pandemic time, like Homegoods, and I saw people who don't keep a social distance when they're picking up the goods, and I want to put a sign to warn people to keep a 6 foot social distance even when they're
				shopping, not just in the checkout line. Also, there is no limit on the number of people in the store, which I feel is terrible as the big company only cares about profit. I may also use the "maximize the number of people sign" outside the
				store and "shopping distance sign" inside the store. The sign may have black text and a simple yellow figure graphic, a red rectangle background.<br>
